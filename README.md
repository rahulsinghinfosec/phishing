# phishing
Phishing is an attempt to display onself as an authentic source in order to steal the credentials of the victim.
Phising attacks are common and it is not possible to distinguish the original site from the disguised one.
The only way you have is by looking at the URL.

I have Used Node.js, with express as a framework.
This code runs locally on your machine on port 3000.
It creates a file called logs.json that stores all the credentials of the users who attempt to register.

If you wish to replicate this, you need to have node.js installed.
You need to install express,ejs and body-parser as well.
Node.js can be downloaded from thier official site https://nodejs.org/en/download/
To install express, ejs and body-parser :
npm install express
npm install ejs
npm install body-parser

OR

npm install express,ejs,body-parser
